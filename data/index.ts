    'I don\'t think \'Muricans understand our struggle as Brits.\n\nWe make a killer sarcastic comment like "I love listicles, they are super useful" and they think we are being serious!\n\nNow most of my European friends will recognise the sarcasm, but as a Brit I do find that my cousins from across the pond struggle with identifying sarcasm, especially in written text. \n\nAnd the scariest part of that is that they might actually think I like listicles ü§¢.\n\n## They should make me Prime Minister\nDo not fear though, dear reader, I have solved the problem. I will be forever heralded as the saviour of USA-UK relations! \n\nMy creation is **that** ground breaking that I truly believe I would make a better PM than Mr Starmer (although that isn\'t a high bar to be fair! üò±ü§£)! \n\nAt the very least I think I am in the running for a Nobel Peace Prize?\n\nPrepare yourself to marvel at the majesty and beauty of the `\u003Csarcasm\u003E` component!\n\n### The sarcasm component\n\n{% codepen https://codepen.io/GrahamTheDev/pen/xbKQjJy %}\n\n## Did you cry?\nI know I did when I saw it take it\'s first breath. The beauty of helping 70 million Brits finally express themselves was overwhelming.\n\nAir quotes in HTML should have been a thing since day 1 of the internet! \n\nIt is bad enough I have to write `color` every day and spell things incorrectly, but I could have easily forgiven that if my needs and those of my fellow Countrymen had been considered elsewhere.\n\nI have finally solved that injustice!\n\n## Go forth and multiply\nTo all my fellow Brits (and other sarcastic so and so\'s!) - go forth and spread the good word.\n\nUse the component everywhere you can and rejoice in your ability to fully express yourself.\n\nAnd you can rest assured you can use it without fear as:\n- It hides the SVGs from screen readers and adds a visually hidden "(sarcasm)" to the end so it is pretty screen reader friendly (open to suggestions on how to improve it though!).\n- If you remove the `rotate(1.5deg)` it would be even more accessible FYI.\n- It will adapt to font sizes and colours so will look ~~ugly~~ **great** in anything you do. \n- Comes with my standard 3 year warranty*\n\n\u003Csmall\u003E* this warranty, as with most warranties, is completely useless as we provide no guarantees either implied or explicit and is included purely for marketing purposes\u003C/small\u003E\n\n## That\'s a wrap.\nA silly article (as to be expected from me) just to get back into the swing of writing and to say hi.\n\nI hope 2025 is treating you well so far and I look forward to writing some more "useful and well thought out" articles and sharing with you all soon. (see why we need the sarcasm component?)\n\n\n\n\n ',
